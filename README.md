# SkinType-PAC45
This repository based from research "Decision Support System (DSS) to Identify Human’s Skin Type Using Path Analysis and Algorithm C4.5"

Our research consist of 2 methods: Path analysis & C4.5 Algorithm

#Path Analysis

<p align="justify"> Before identifying the skin type from the dataset, first we will find out the correlation between variable and search the causal relationship between daily skin conditions and skin type.

#C4.5

<p align="justify">Furthermore, with C4.5, we made a decision tree to determine human’s skin type based from the skin conditions data we’ve gathered and then evaluate it. Based from several experiments we did, the model has an overall accuracy value 74%. It can be concluded that this model is good enough as a Decision Support System (DSS) and used in determining a person's facial skin type.
